# AI Plays

This repository is a collection of various classical AI and Reinforcement Learning algorithms for building agents that can play simple games or solve problems. This repository is like my workspace for AI as I learn to implement various Classical AI algorithms and applying Reinforcement Learning algorithms on those problems.
