# AI Plays

This repository is a collection various AI algorithms for building a bot that can play simple games or solve foundational problems. This repository is like my workspace for AI as I learn to implement various Classical AI algorithms and applying (Deep) Reinforcement Learning algorithms on those problems.

## Contents

1. [Implementation of Two Player TicTacToe Game](tictactoe/)
2. [Solving N-Queens (a Constraint Satisfaction Problem) with Backtracking](tictactoe/)

## TODO

A checklist of things to do in this repository.

- [x] Code a Normal 2 Player TicTacToe Terminal Game
- [x] Solving a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (NQueens) using Backtracking
- [ ] Convert the Game to a Gym Environment or a similar Interface so that the AI can interact with it easily.
- [ ] MinMax Algorithm and Self-Play
- [ ] NeuroEvolution
- [ ] Classical Q Learning
- [ ] Deep Q Learning
- [ ] AlphaZero with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- [ ] MuZero
