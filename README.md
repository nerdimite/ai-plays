# AI Plays TicTacToe

This repository is a collection various AI algorithms for building a bot that can play TicTacToe. This repository is like my workspace for AI as I learn to implement various Classical AI algorithms and (Deep) Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

## Algorithms to Implement

- [x] Code a Normal 2 Player TicTacToe Terminal Game
- [ ] Convert the Game to a Gym Environment or a similar Interface so that the AI can interact with it easily.
- [ ] MinMax Algorithm and Self-Play
- [ ] NeuroEvolution
- [ ] Classical Q Learning
- [ ] Deep Q Learning
- [ ] AlphaZero with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- [ ] MuZero
